            Hi, I'm <strong>Clarizabelle Flores</strong>, a wannabe globe-trotter.
            People call me Clarize, Clarisa, Bela, or Belle,
            so choose whichever you're comfortable with. I'm currently working full-time,
            studying, and juggling everything in between. Aside from living life as it is,
            I am passionate about running. I've only been a runner for more than a year,
            but it's fair to say I'm not stopping anytime soon. I took up Diploma in
            Computer Science so I can continue educating myself on the latest in technology,
            which, as we all know, is constantly evolving, and to equip myself
            with the fundamentals of computer science. On top of that, I am and will always be
            a Potterhead. I grew up with the books and movies, and you're never too old to
            still wait for that Hogwarts letter to arrive. When I'm not busy with work,
            school, or running, I love going to the beach,<img src="images/about-me-beach.JPG" alt="beach" class="img-left"> 
            not to bask under the heat of the sun, but to savor the beauty of it all. 
            The calming sound of the waves, the magnificent sunset, and the powdery sand 
            beneath my feet help clear my head and prepare me to take on the hustle and bustle of the city.
        </p>

            <h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        </div>
            <p>In a world full of responsibilities, finding time for the things that make us happy 
                isn't always easy. But we only live once, so I try to make the most of it and do what 
                puts a smile on my face. For me, that means the rush of a good run, the sound of an 
                acoustic guitar, or the simple joy of a great cup of coffee, these little moments 
                make life more fulfilling.
            </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Running
                <p>
                    I started running thinking it would just be another cardio to add to my routine but here I am,
                    more than a year later, having just finished my first marathon. Mind you, I didn't enjoy it too
                    much at first because I could barely run for 10 seconds! Even just a jog would have left me out
                    of breath. Yet, I find solace in my runs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's great about running is that you can do it alone, and no runner will pass judgment. 
                    You can also join a running club, where complete strangers will cheer you on and stick with you
                    through the longest, grueling runs you'll ever have to endure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, after finishing my first marathon, you can bet I'll do it again!

            </div>
            <li>Playing guitar
                <p>
                    Whenever I want to clear my mind or if a good song pops into my head, I'll get up and play my 
                    guitar. I'm not some guitar virtuoso, but I just love the sound of that acoustic guitar, as there's 
                    something warm and soulful about it, even though I don't play perfectly. It's an instrument that, 
                    for me, has its own soul, each strum, pluck, hammer-on, carries a kind of passion that words 
                    sometimes can't convey. Whether it's a familiar song or a new one, playing always gives me a 
                    sense of calm and peace.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Watching Movies & TV Series
                <p>
                    Me, the couch, TV or laptop, and a good movie or TV series-now that's a day well spent, 
                    especially before I started working. Though I don't have much time or the luxury to just watch 
                    all day and night, I still find time to watch or rewatch my favorites-from old movies and TV 
                    series to the new ones, even adding documentaries, and stand-up comedies to the list. So, how 
                    do I still watch them? I squeeze in episodes during break time and while running on the 
                    treadmill. It's like killing two birds with one stone!
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                Busy mode is the default for us adults. But even in this demanding life, I still want to do more-there's
                so much to explore. One thing I'm always fond of is having a good cup of coffee, whether 
                at home, in a quaint coffee shop, or a well-known coffee joint. As long as it's good, I'm 
                drinking it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond great coffee, I also love good food-especially when I get to try it in the place where it 
                originally comes from. There's something special about tasting a dish in its place of origin, 
                knowing it's prepared just the way it should be.
            </p>
            <p>
                And whenever I can, I travel. There's always something new to experience-activities to try, 
                must-see attractions, local delicacies to savor, and interesting people to meet. No matter how 
                short or long the trip, every journey is euphoric.
            </p>
